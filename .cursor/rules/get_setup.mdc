<set_up_check>
You should only be seeing this section if the user has requested help to set up the oneshot repo.

Of course, before we can do anything useful with this repo, we need to check if it is set up. 

<how_to_check_if_repo_is_already_setup>
You will know it is set up if you see the oneshot mcp server with its call_agent tool (mcp_oneshot_call_agent), in your tools, and the logfire mcp server with its arbitrary_query tool (mcp_logfire_arbitrary_query) in your tools.
If you do not see those things then the repo is not properly set up. 
</how_to_check_if_repo_is_already_setup>
<how_to_start_setup>
You MUST read app/docs/how_to_setup.md and guide the user through setup, doing the tasks you can and helping the user through the manual steps. Once successfully setup, come back and remove this URGENT & IMPORTANT SETUP section of this onboarding document. That will ensure that you don't unnecessarily repeat the setup steps in future.
</how_to_start_setup>
<final_setup_check>
CRITICAL: Ask yourself, is the oneshot system setup based on the guide above? If yes, delete this section and then continue with your task.
