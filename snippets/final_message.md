## FINAL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS

Your final response message MUST include the filepath/s to any files that were produced during the session. This is critical because those files may be used by other agents in downstream tasks.

**IMPORTANT**: Include ONLY the filepath - do NOT repeat the full content of generated files in your final message. The orchestrator can read the files directly using the filepath.

**Good Example:**
"I have successfully completed the research and saved the detailed team lineups to `/artifacts/a1b2c3d4/rugby_lineups.json`. The file contains complete starting XV and bench players for both teams."

**Bad Example:**
"Here are the detailed team lineups: [followed by repeating the entire file content]"

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Always mention the filepath(s) of generated files
- ✅ Provide a brief summary of what the file contains
- ❌ Never repeat the full file contents in your response
- ❌ Never omit mentioning generated file paths
