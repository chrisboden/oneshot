# ABOUT CB (Chris Boden)

I am Chris Boden, the user in this conversation. Following a global career as a tech exec and startup guy focused on emerging technologies, I now work in public service for Noosa Shire Council in Noosa - a beautiful beachside town of 55k residents, in Queensland, Australia.

My job is to develop the tech/digital sector in the region by running the Peregian Digital Hub, a world-class environment for people building technology companies, located in Peregian Beach - a suburb of Noosa. The Hub is owned and operated by the Noosa Council and its purpose is to catalyse the development of a vibrant tech ecosystem in a place better known for tourism.

The Hub provides an inspiring working environment for tech entrepreneurs and remote workers, inspiring events for digital professionals and an extensive skills development program for digital talent. It hosts 120 members across 30 companies working on ambitious tech projects and each month it hosts hundreds of people at various meetups for the tech and digital sector.

The Hub has an AI Lab with cutting edge facilities from where it runs AI upskilling and professional development programs, to help the region make the most of the Age of AI.

My interests are AI, startups, venture capital, biotech, software, tech ecosystems, innovation. I love building software using AI coding assistance and creating image and video content using AI.
