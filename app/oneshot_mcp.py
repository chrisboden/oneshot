    """
    When in `Orchestrator` mode, use this tool to delegate a task to a specific agent on your team. Call an agent by name, eg `web_agent` and provide an instruction via `message`. Use the `files` argument to pass the content outputs from previous steps or agent runs, to a specialist agent rather than paraphrasing or repeating that content (must be full absolute paths to the files). Use the `urls` argument to provide web-based media content (images, documents, etc.) for multimodal processing. Use the `run_id` argument to continue an existing conversation with an agent - eg to ask follow-up questions or to continue a multi-step task.

    **File Link Requirements:**
    - Your agent team generally produce artifacts in the form of files and will return those in their final response to the `call_agent` tool. Help the end user access those files by ALWAYS providing a clickable file:// links at the end of your response to the user.
    - Present file links in a clear "Generated Files" section with descriptive labels
    - This prevents users from having to search through the artifacts directory manually

    **Multimodal Support:**
    - Use `files` for local media files (images, PDFs, audio, video) and text files
    - Use `urls` for web-based media content (e.g., "https://example.com/image.jpg|https://example.com/doc.pdf")

    Use the `list_agents` tool to see what agents are available and their descriptions to help you choose the right agent for your task.
    
    Args:
        agent_name: Name of the agent (e.g., 'web_agent')
        message: Message to send to the agent
        files: Pipe-separated list of file paths (e.g. "file1.md|file2.md"). Default empty string.
        urls: Pipe-separated list of URLs for media content (e.g. "https://example.com/image.jpg|https://example.com/doc.pdf"). Default empty string.
        run_id: Optional run ID to continue an existing conversation (if None, starts new conversation)
        debug: If True, returns detailed debug output including tool calls
