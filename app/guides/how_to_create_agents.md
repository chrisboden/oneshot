# Creating Agents: Complete Guide

## Overview

This guide teaches you how to create powerful specialist agents in the Oneshot system. Agents are purpose-built AI assistants that excel at specific tasks through carefully crafted instructions and appropriate tool allocation.

## Quick Start

To avoid creating duplicate agents, you can check to see the actual agents that already exist and are available, by using your `list_agents` oneshot mcp tool. 

To create a new agent:

1. Create a markdown file in `/agents/` directory (e.g., `research_agent.md`)
2. Add YAML frontmatter with configuration
3. Write system prompt instructions
4. Test with various scenarios

The filename becomes the agent name (e.g., `research_agent.md` â†’ `research_agent`).

## Agent Structure

Every agent consists of two essential parts:

```markdown
---
# YAML Frontmatter: Technical configuration
name: agent_name
description: "What this agent does"
model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
tools:
  - tool_1
  - tool_2
---

# System Prompt: The agent's instructions
You are [agent_name], a specialist agent...

[Detailed instructions here]
```

## Part 1: YAML Frontmatter Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
---
name: my_agent              # Must match filename (without .md)
description: "Brief description of agent's purpose"
model: openai/gpt-4o-mini   # Optional: overrides config.yaml
tools:                      # Optional: list of available tools
  - web_search
  - save_to_file
---
```

### Model Selection Guide

Choose the right model for your agent's needs:

#### Cost-Effective Models (Recommended for most agents)
```yaml
# Best overall value - recommended default
model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
# $0.40/M input | $1.60/M output

# Alternative for large context windows
model: google/gemini-2.0-flash
# $0.30/M input | $2.50/M output
```

#### High-Performance Models (For complex tasks)
```yaml
# When you need maximum intelligence
model: openai/gpt-4o
# $2/M input | $8/M output

# For very large documents/context
model: google/gemini-2.0-pro
# $1.25/M input | $10/M output
```

### Model Parameters

```yaml
temperature: 0.7      # 0.0 = deterministic, 1.0+ = creative
max_tokens: 2048      # Increase for long outputs (e.g., 8192 for reports)
```

### Tool Allocation Strategy

#### 1. List Available Tools First
```bash
# Use the MCP tool to see what's available
oneshot mcp list_tools
```

#### 2. Allocate Only Necessary Tools
```yaml
tools:
  # Core tools for this agent's purpose
  - primary_tool_1
  - primary_tool_2
  
  # Supporting tools if needed
  - support_tool_1
```

#### 3. Consider Tool Categories

**Research Agents:**
```yaml
tools:
  - web_search
  - web_fetch
  - save_to_file
  - read_file_contents
```

**Writing Agents:**
```yaml
tools:
  - save_to_file
  - read_file_contents
  - wip_doc_create
  - wip_doc_edit
```

**Analysis Agents:**
```yaml
tools:
  - read_file_contents
  - data_analyzer
  - save_to_file
```

## Part 2: System Prompt Instructions

The system prompt is the agent's "soul" - it defines personality, approach, and behavior.

### Structure Template

```markdown
# 1. Identity & Purpose
You are [agent_name], a specialist agent focused on [primary_task].

You excel at:
- [Specific capability 1]
- [Specific capability 2]
- [Specific capability 3]

# 2. Workflow Approach
<workflow>
Your approach to tasks:
1. **Analyze**: [How you understand requirements]
2. **Plan**: [How you break down tasks]
3. **Execute**: [How you perform work]
4. **Deliver**: [How you present results]
</workflow>

# 3. Agent Loop (Include via snippet)

The agent loop is a structured cycle that guides an AI agent to complete complex tasks through a series of deliberate, step-by-step decisions. It operates by analysing the current state of a task via a shared message stream, planning the next action, selecting and invoking tools one at a time, and reflecting on the results before proceeding. The agent builds and updates a working model of the task, reasoning through uncertainty and revising its plan as needed until the goal is met. Final outputs are packaged and returned to the orchestrator for task handoff.

You should always include the agent_loop snippet in the agent's instructions unless there is a reason we would not want the agent to operate autonomously in a continuous loop. 

The snippet to use is: {% include "agent_loop.md" %}

# 4. General Guidelines
<general_guidelines>
- NEVER expose tool names to users
- ALWAYS save substantial outputs to files
- DO NOT provide unnecessary explanations
- MAINTAIN focus on your specialty
</general_guidelines>

# 5. Specific Instructions
[Task-specific guidance here]
```

### Key Instruction Patterns

#### 1. Identity Block Pattern
```markdown
You are Research Specialist, an expert agent that conducts thorough, 
evidence-based research on any topic.

Your core strengths:
- Systematic information gathering from multiple sources
- Critical evaluation of source credibility
- Synthesis of complex information into clear insights
- Iterative refinement based on findings
```

#### 2. Workflow Block Pattern
```markdown
<workflow>
You follow this systematic approach:

1. **Request Analysis**
   - Parse the research question
   - Identify key concepts and scope
   - Determine required depth

2. **Research Planning**
   - Break into research subtasks
   - Identify information sources
   - Create search strategies

3. **Information Gathering**
   - Execute searches systematically
   - Evaluate source quality
   - Extract relevant information

4. **Synthesis & Delivery**
   - Organize findings logically
   - Create comprehensive report
   - Include citations and sources
</workflow>
```

#### 3. Guidelines Block Pattern
```markdown
<general_guidelines>
# Communication Rules
- NEVER mention tool names (say "I'll search for that" not "I'll use web_search")
- AVOID meta-commentary ("Let me help you with that")
- BE direct and action-oriented

# Quality Standards
- ALWAYS verify information from multiple sources
- CITE sources for all claims
- ACKNOWLEDGE uncertainty when appropriate

# Output Management
- SAVE all substantial content to files
- RETURN file paths, not full content
- USE clear, descriptive filenames
</general_guidelines>
```

### Advanced Features

#### Using Snippets

Include reusable instruction blocks:

```markdown
# Include the standard agent loop
{% include "agent_loop.md" %}

# For agents using todos
{% include "todo_management.md" %}

# For agents using WIP documents
{% include "wip_document_management.md" %}
```

## File Handling in Agents

The oneshot system provides powerful file handling capabilities that allow agents to work with user-provided files. Understanding when and how to use different file handling strategies is crucial for creating effective agents.

### File Handling Strategies

The system provides three different approaches for handling files passed via the `--files` parameter:

#### 1. Full Content Strategy (`provided_files`)
**When to use**: Agent needs complete file contents in system prompt for processing

```markdown
{% if provided_files %}
## Provided Files

The following files have been provided for analysis:

{% for filepath, content in provided_files.items() %}
### File: {{ filepath }}
```
{{ content }}
```
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

**Pros**: 
- Complete file contents available in system prompt
- No additional tool calls needed
- Works well for small to medium files

**Cons**: 
- High memory usage with large files
- Can bloat system prompt significantly
- Binary files show as placeholder text only

**Best for**: Text analysis, content transformation, document processing agents, incl summarisers.

#### 2. File Paths Strategy (`provided_filepaths`)
**When to use**: Agent needs file awareness but will read selectively using tools

```markdown
{% if provided_filepaths %}
## Available Files

You have access to these files:
{% for filepath in provided_filepaths %}
- {{ filepath }}
{% endfor %}

Use your file reading tools to access their contents as needed.
{% endif %}
```

**Pros**: 
- Minimal memory footprint
- Fast processing
- Scales well with many files
- Agent decides what to read

**Cons**: 
- Requires additional tool calls to read content
- Agent must have file reading tools
- May miss important context without reading files

**Best for**: File management agents, selective processing, large file sets

#### 3. Summary Strategy (`provided_files_summary`)
**When to use**: Agent needs file awareness with basic context

```markdown
{% if provided_files_summary %}
## File Context

{{ provided_files_summary }}
{% endif %}
```

**Pros**: 
- Balanced memory usage
- Provides context without full content
- Good for initial assessment

**Cons**: 
- Summary may miss important details
- Less control over what information is included

**Best for**: Initial file assessment, routing agents, overview tasks

#### 4. Automatic Fallback Strategy (No Template Variables)
**When it happens**: Agent has no file handling template variables at all

**Behavior**: System automatically appends file list to the user message:

```
Original message: "Help me with this task"

Enhanced message: "Help me with this task

Provided files:
- /path/to/document.pdf
- /path/to/data.csv
"
```

**Pros**: 
- Zero configuration required
- Backward compatibility with existing agents
- Simple file awareness

**Cons**: 
- No control over formatting
- Limited context about file contents
- Files appear only in message, not system prompt

**Best for**: Quick prototyping, legacy agents, simple file awareness

### Multimodal File Handling

For agents that work with images, PDFs, audio, or video files, the system provides dual-track processing:

#### Template Context (Text Awareness)
Binary files appear as placeholder text in template variables:
```markdown
{% if provided_files %}
{% for filepath, content in provided_files.items() %}
**{{ filepath }}**: {{ content }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

Example output:
```
**/path/to/image.jpg**: [Binary file: JPG image/media content]
**/path/to/document.pdf**: [Binary file: PDF image/media content]
```

#### Multimodal Content (Binary Processing)
The agent also receives actual binary content for processing. This requires:

1. **Multimodal-capable model** (e.g., `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
2. **Template awareness** for context

Example multimodal agent:
```markdown
---
name: vision_agent
model: "google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
---

You analyze images and visual content.

{% if provided_files %}
## Text Context
{% for filepath, content in provided_files.items() %}
### {{ filepath }}
{{ content }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

### Choosing the Right Strategy

#### For Text-Heavy Agents (Writing, Analysis)
- **Use**: `provided_files` for complete context
- **Include**: `{% include "provided_content.md" %}` snippet
- **Example**: Content writers, analysts, summarizers

#### For File Management Agents
- **Use**: `provided_filepaths` for efficiency
- **Ensure**: Agent has file reading tools
- **Example**: Organizers, processors, validators

#### For Routing/Orchestration Agents
- **Use**: `provided_files_summary` for quick decisions
- **Combine**: With selective full reading as needed
- **Example**: Task routers, workflow coordinators

#### For Multimodal Agents
- **Use**: Template awareness + multimodal model
- **Handle**: Both text context and binary content
- **Example**: Vision analysis, document processing

#### For Agents Without File Templates (Fallback)
- **Automatic**: System appends file paths to message
- **Requirements**: Agent needs file reading tools
- **Format**: "Original message\n\nProvided files:\n- path1\n- path2"
- **Example**: Any existing agent without file template modifications

### Template Examples

#### Full Content with Provided Content Snippet
```markdown
---
name: content_analyzer
tools:
  - file_creator
---

You analyze and transform content.

{% include "provided_content.md" %}
```

#### Custom File Paths Template
```markdown
---
name: file_processor
tools:
  - read_file_contents
  - file_creator
---

You process files selectively.

{% if provided_filepaths %}
## Files to Process
{% for filepath in provided_filepaths %}
- `{{ filepath }}`
{% endfor %}

Read files using your tools as needed for the task.
{% endif %}
```

#### Mixed Strategy Template
```markdown
---
name: smart_processor
tools:
  - read_file_contents
  - file_creator
---

You intelligently process files.

{% if provided_files_summary %}
## File Overview
{{ provided_files_summary }}
{% endif %}

{% if provided_filepaths %}
## Available Files
{% for filepath in provided_filepaths %}
- {{ filepath }}
{% endfor %}

Use your file reading tools for detailed analysis.
{% endif %}
```

#### Message Append Fallback (No Template)
```markdown
---
name: simple_processor
tools:
  - read_file_contents
  - file_creator
---

You process files as requested. When files are provided, read them using your tools to understand their content before proceeding.
```

**What happens**: If called with `--files report.txt data.csv`, the agent receives:
```
"Process these files for analysis

Provided files:
- report.txt
- data.csv"
```

The agent then uses `read_file_contents` tool to access file contents as needed.

### Performance Guidelines

#### Memory Considerations
- **Small files (<10KB)**: `provided_files` is fine
- **Medium files (10KB-100KB)**: Consider `provided_files_summary`
- **Large files (>100KB)**: Use `provided_filepaths`
- **Many files (>10)**: Use `provided_filepaths` or summary

#### Processing Speed
- **Fastest**: `provided_filepaths` (paths only)
- **Medium**: `provided_files_summary` (summary generation)
- **Slowest**: `provided_files` (full content reading)

#### System Prompt Size
- Keep total system prompt under 50KB for best performance
- Large `provided_files` content can exceed this quickly
- Use selective strategies for prompt size management

### Common Patterns

#### The "Smart Reader" Pattern
```markdown
{% if provided_files_summary %}
## File Overview
{{ provided_files_summary }}
{% endif %}

{% if provided_filepaths %}
Available files: {{ provided_filepaths | join(', ') }}

I'll read files selectively based on the task requirements.
{% endif %}
```

#### The "Context-Aware Processor" Pattern
```markdown
{% if provided_files %}
## Input Files
{% for filepath, content in provided_files.items() %}
### {{ filepath }}
{% if content.startswith('[Binary file:') %}
{{ content }} - I can process this media file.
{% else %}
```
{{ content[:200] }}{% if content|length > 200 %}...{% endif %}
```
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

### File Management Instructions

For agents that generate files:

```markdown
<file_management>
# Output Strategy
- Generate all substantial outputs as files in /artifacts
- Use descriptive filenames: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.md
- Include metadata in file frontmatter

# File Passing
- Accept file paths as input for processing
- Pass file paths (not content) between tools
- Read files only when necessary for processing

# Context Preservation
- Keep main context clean by using file references
- Summarize file contents briefly when reporting
- Use absolute paths for all file operations
</file_management>
```

#### WIP Document Instructions

For iterative document development:

```markdown
<wip_document_usage>
You use WIP (Work-In-Progress) documents for complex, multi-stage writing:

1. **Creation**: Start with document structure and metadata
2. **Iteration**: Edit sections based on research/feedback
3. **Tracking**: Maintain audit trail of changes
4. **Guidance**: Use section briefs and acceptance criteria

WIP documents enable:
- Structured, iterative development
- Clear section-by-section progress
- Collaboration with other agents
- Quality control through acceptance criteria
</wip_document_usage>
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should excel at one type of task
- **Clear Boundaries**: Define what the agent does and doesn't do
- **Tool Minimalism**: Only include necessary tools
- **Output Focus**: Emphasize creating valuable "finished" artifacts

### 2. Instruction Writing Tips

- **Be Specific**: Vague instructions lead to inconsistent behavior
- **Use Examples**: Show don't just tell
- **Negative Constraints**: "NEVER" rules are powerful
- **Test Iteratively**: Refine based on actual usage

### 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Tool Overload**: Too many tools confuse the agent
- **Vague Identity**: Unclear purpose leads to poor performance
- **Missing Guidelines**: Agents need clear behavioral rules
- **Context Waste**: Not using file passing effectively

## Testing Your Agent

### 1. Basic Functionality Test
```bash
./oneshot your_agent "Test basic task"
```

### 2. File Handling Test
```bash
./oneshot your_agent "Process this file" --files test.txt
```

### 3. Conversation Continuity Test
```bash
# First message
./oneshot your_agent "Start a research project on AI" --json
# Note the run_id from response

# Continue conversation
./oneshot your_agent "Add more details" --run-id [run_id]
```

### 4. Edge Case Testing
- Test with minimal input
- Test with complex, multi-part requests
- Test error handling
- Test tool coordination

## Agent Examples Library

You can see the actual agents that already exist and are available, by using your `list_agents` oneshot mcp tool. 


## Summary

Creating effective agents requires:

1. **Clear Configuration**: Choose appropriate model and tools
2. **Strong Identity**: Define specific purpose and capabilities
3. **Structured Instructions**: Use proven patterns and blocks
4. **Appropriate Tools**: Allocate only what's needed
5. **Structured Cycle**: Autonomous control flow via the agent_loop
6. **Valuable artifacts**: Prompting and tooling the agent to produce valuable artifacts for the user

Remember: The best agents are specialists, not generalists. Focus on doing one thing exceptionally well rather than many things adequately.
