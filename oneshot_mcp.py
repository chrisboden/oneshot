    """
    Call an agent by name with a message using the `oneshot` bash script. Use this tool to delegate tasks to specialist agents. Call an agent by name, eg `web_agent` and provide an instruction via `message`. Use the `files` argument to pass the content outputs from previous steps to a specialist agent rather than paraphrasing or repeating that content (must be full absolute paths to the files). Use the `run_id` argument to continue an existing conversation with an agent - eg to ask follow-up questions or to continue a multi-step task.

    **File Link Requirements:**
    - When an agent generates or saves files, ALWAYS provide clickable file:// links at the end of your response
    - Parse the agent's response for any file paths mentioned (look for patterns like `/artifacts/`, `.md`, `.json`, etc.)
    - Convert absolute file paths to clickable file:// URLs (e.g., `file:///Users/chrisboden/Dropbox/AI/oneshot/artifacts/...`)
    - Present file links in a clear "Generated Files" section with descriptive labels
    - This prevents users from having to search through the artifacts directory manually

    Use the `list_agents` tool first to see what agents are available and their descriptions to help you choose the right agent for your task.
    
    Args:
        agent_name: Name of the agent (e.g., 'web_agent')
        message: Message to send to the agent
        files: Pipe-separated list of file paths (e.g. "file1.md|file2.md"). Default empty string.
        run_id: Optional run ID to continue an existing conversation (if None, starts new conversation)
        debug: If True, returns detailed debug output including tool calls
